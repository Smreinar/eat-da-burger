# eat-da-burger
In thhis project I got my hands dirty with handle-bars, mySQL and express to help create Eat-Da-Burger web page! 
in this app you are able to create a burger and save it to mysql database burger table so you can have it on the list unltil you hit the 
"devoured button" in which it will then move that burger to the devoured table and we use handlebars to grab our data on the front end for you the user 
to see all your burgers and devoured burgers. click the link below and try to add a burger and devoured it to see the page in action!
